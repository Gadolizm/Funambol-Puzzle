# Funambol-Puzzle
SwiftUI-based 3x3 tile puzzle for the Funambol technical challenge. Loads an image from the web or local fallback, splits it into tiles, and lets users swap them via drag-and-drop. Correct tiles lock in place, with completion detection, optional state persistence, and unit test coverage.
